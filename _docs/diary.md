# Project Diary — Clown Circus Reloaded

This diary records the evolution of Clown Circus Reloaded, from the initial setup through the development process, documenting key activities, AI tool usage, decisions, experiments, and lessons learned.

## 2026-10-13 — Project initialization

### Repository setup

I manually created a new private GitHub repository for Clown Circus Reloaded and drafted the initial `README.md`. At this stage, the README contained only the project's idea, motivation, and the intention to revisit my 2025 capstone using the more mature AI-assisted software engineering practices covered by the second edition of the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp.

The goal is not simply to rebuild the same game, but to investigate how the development process can evolve when revisiting an existing project with a more advanced AI engineering toolbox.

### Course knowledge base

Before starting implementation or delegating work to an AI coding agent, I created `docs/course_KB/` to collect the course materials and related reference documents.

This knowledge base is intended to provide the AI agent with a grounded source of context about the course's methodologies, concepts, and project requirements. The original materials will serve as references throughout the project rather than being replaced by summaries generated in advance.

### Next step

Before making architectural or implementation decisions, I will ask ZCode to analyze the original 2025 repository and the course knowledge base. The objective is to reconstruct the existing product, architecture, and AI-assisted development workflow, then compare them with the opportunities offered by the 2026 course.

This initial discovery phase should produce a documented baseline and identify open questions without modifying the application code or committing to a new architecture.

## 2026-10-13 — Discovery phase (executed by ZCode)

### Task delegated

Following the plan above, I delegated the discovery to **ZCode**, the AI coding agent driving this project, with an analysis-only mandate:

- Reconstruct the 2025 **Clown Circus Carnival** baseline (product, architecture, testing, deployment) from the repository at [lucapug/clown-circus-carnival](https://github.com/lucapug/clown-circus-carnival) — code, all three branches (`main`, `logic`, `style`), full commit history and authorship, the 17 pull requests, and the governance documents.
- Reconstruct the **2025 AI-assisted development workflow**: which tools did what, boundaries, human orchestration, and guardrails — explicitly treating it as an existing AI-engineering experiment rather than a conventionally built app.
- Analyze the **2026 course knowledge base** in `docs/course_KB/` (course overview, module 1–5 companion articles, the "Use Claude Code Like a Pro" webinar worksheet, project requirements, and the online rubric), preserving the course's own terminology.
- Compare the 2025 baseline with the 2026 opportunities, labeling facts, interpretations, and unknowns — **without** making architectural decisions, committing to a stack, or modifying any existing file.

### Outcome

ZCode delivered the report at [`_docs/2025-baseline-vs-2026-opportunities.md`](2025-baseline-vs-2026-opportunities.md). It was the only file created during this phase. Key findings:

- **The 2025 project was a real multi-agent experiment.** Lovable.dev generated the MVP and owned visuals/sound on the `style` branch, Roo Code (GLM-4.7) owned architecture and API design on `logic`, GitHub Copilot owned implementation and tests, and the human acted as lead and sole merger across 17 PRs. The division of labor was documented in `AGENTS.md` files and branch-aware Copilot instructions, and partially enforced by a CI guardrails workflow policing branch-merge direction.
- **Its structural gaps were unplanned work and unverified gameplay.** No product spec, no backlog, zero GitHub issues; the 44 tests arrived on day 11 of 13 explicitly "to reach full marks in the project rubric"; the game itself was verified only by playing it, and the final three PRs were still logic bug fixes. ZCode also confirmed a dead-end feature (`bonusJumps` displayed but never consumed) and an unimplemented ADR promise (localStorage fallback).
- **The 2026 course's through-line is making those improvisations structural:** specs and checkable acceptance criteria, groomed issue backlogs, loop/graph orchestration, subagents with isolated contexts and tool walls, hooks as un-bypassable gates, skills/MCP/plugins, E2E automation, CI/CD with health validation, OpenTelemetry observability, AI on-call response, and security audits. The 2026 rubric (14 criteria, 33 points) adds two graded categories with no 2025 counterpart: **Agent Extension Pack** and **Security, Audit, and DevOps Hardening**.
- **Real continuities exist:** AGENTS.md instructions, CI guardrails, OpenAPI-first design, Lovable-first frontend generation, single-container deployment, SQLite→Postgres, and uv were all already present in 2025.

### Limitations recorded

The deployed 2025 app on Render is offline (no runtime verification possible); the webinar's slides and starter project are missing from the KB; the original Lovable/Roo/Copilot prompts do not survive in Git; the 2026 rubric is still marked as a draft online.

### Next step

Review the report's open questions and next-phase topics (product scope, spec artifact, verification strategy for a canvas game, orchestration and delivery models), then decide the scope and process for the reimplementation before any code is written.
